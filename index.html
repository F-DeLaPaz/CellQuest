      <h1>🔬 Mitosis: Cellular Dispatch</h1>
      <p>Welcome to the BioForge Command Center! Under COO-Key's guidance, you'll dispatch freshly-mitosed cells to save the body one mission at a time.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>🧬 What is Mitosis?</h2>
      <p><strong>Mitosis</strong> is a type of cell division that produces two identical daughter cells from a single parent cell. In this game, it's the backbone of how you generate immune responders to meet biological challenges.</p>

      <h2>📖 Game Summary</h2>
      <p>You're a cellular response dispatcher. Monitor alerts, assign cell types, and learn science along the way. Each response uses <strong>mitosis</strong> to create specialized cells that travel via CTS delivery routes to the affected area.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>🎮 Game Mechanics</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>🔍 <strong>Read the Alert</strong> – Examine the scenario for clues.</li>
        <li>🧪 <strong>Choose Cells</strong> – Pick the best responders based on cell function.</li>
        <li>🧬 <strong>Mitosis Happens</strong> – iPSCs in the BioForge replicate and differentiate.</li>
        <li>📦 <strong>CTS Delivers</strong> – The right route (like Lymphatic Express) moves them fast.</li>
        <li>🎯 <strong>Review Outcome</strong> – Score accuracy and learn from feedback.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>🧪 Sample Scenario Preview</h2>
      <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Read the alert message carefully. Select the best two cell types that would respond effectively. Use your understanding of cell function to make informed choices.</p>

      <p><strong>Sample Alert:</strong><br>
      “A mild abrasion on the forearm has allowed environmental bacteria to enter. Swelling and redness are observed. Immediate immune support required.”</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A. Phagocytes</li>
        <li>B. Erythrocytes</li>
        <li>C. Platelets</li>
        <li>D. Neurons</li>
      </ul>

      <p><em>Answer: A and C.</em>  
      Phagocytes consume invading bacteria, while platelets help seal the wound to prevent further intrusion. Erythrocytes transport oxygen but do not fight infection. Neurons are not relevant to injury repair or immunity in this case.</p>
