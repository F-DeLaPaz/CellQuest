      <h1>üìö BioForge Dispatch Glossary</h1>
      <p>This glossary explains all key terms, processes, cells, transports, and diagnoses used in BioForge Dispatch missions. Use it anytime to review terminology and biological functions encountered in gameplay.</p>

    <!-- SECTION 1: CORE PROCESSES & SYSTEMS -->
    <section>
      <h2>üî¨ Core Processes & Systems</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Apoptosis</strong>: Programmed cell death that safely eliminates unnecessary or damaged cells after mitosis or incorrect production.</li>
        <li><strong>BioForge</strong>: The cellular production facility where stem cells divide via mitosis to create responder cells for dispatch missions.</li>
        <li><strong>COO-Key</strong>: Chief Operations Organizer ‚Äî your AI mission supervisor, provides feedback, override support, and dispatch guidance.</li>
        <li><strong>CTS (Cellular Transport System)</strong>: Delivery network that routes responder cells to correct tissue using lymphatic, blood, or epithelial pathways.</li>
        <li><strong>iPSCs (Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells)</strong>: Master stem cells capable of becoming any specialized cell type needed for repair or immune response.</li>
        <li><strong>Mitosis</strong>: Cell division process where one cell splits into two identical daughter cells, producing responders for healing and defense.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 2: TRANSPORT SYSTEMS -->
    <section>
      <h2>üöö Transport Systems</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Coronary Circulation</strong>: Specialized blood vessels that deliver cells directly to heart muscle tissue.</li>
        <li><strong>Epithelial Migration</strong>: Cells move across skin or mucosal surfaces to repair and rebuild tissues (e.g., keratinocytes, goblet cells).</li>
        <li><strong>Lymphatic Vessels</strong>: Pathways that transport immune cells like phagocytes and mast cells to infection or injury sites.</li>
        <li><strong>Vascular System (Bloodstream)</strong>: Main circulatory system delivering oxygen, nutrients, and certain responder cells through arteries, veins, and capillaries.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 3: CELLS -->
    <section>
      <h2>üß¨ Cells</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cardiomyocyte</strong>: Specialized heart muscle cells responsible for heart contraction and pumping blood through the body.</li>
        <li><strong>Erythrocyte (Red Blood Cell)</strong>: Transports oxygen throughout the bloodstream to tissues; not involved in immune defense or repair.</li>
        <li><strong>Fibroblast</strong>: Produces collagen and connective tissue, stabilizing damaged tissues during wound healing and scar formation.</li>
        <li><strong>Goblet Cell</strong>: Secretes mucus to trap pathogens and particles along mucous membranes, protecting airway and eye surfaces.</li>
        <li><strong>Keratinocyte</strong>: Skin barrier cells that regenerate and repair epidermis after damage or infection; rebuild skin structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Mast Cell</strong>: Triggers allergic responses by releasing histamine and other chemicals to recruit immune defense in mucosal tissues.</li>
        <li><strong>Melanocyte</strong>: Produces melanin pigment that protects skin by absorbing ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight.</li>
        <li><strong>Neuron</strong>: Nerve cell that transmits electrical signals for sensation, motor function, and coordination; not involved in healing.</li>
        <li><strong>Osteocyte</strong>: Mature bone cell involved in maintaining bone structure; not relevant for immune or soft tissue repair.</li>
        <li><strong>Phagocyte</strong>: White blood cell that engulfs and digests foreign invaders such as bacteria, fungi, or debris to fight infection.</li>
        <li><strong>Platelet</strong>: Small blood fragments that initiate blood clotting when injury causes bleeding; not involved in cellular repair.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 4: DIAGNOSES -->
    <section>
      <h2>ü©∫ Diagnoses</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Allergic Conjunctivitis</strong>: Eye inflammation triggered by allergens, causing redness, itching, swelling, and watery discharge.</li>
        <li><strong>Arrhythmia</strong>: Abnormal heart rhythm causing irregular, too fast, or too slow heartbeat patterns.</li>
        <li><strong>Athlete's Foot (Tinea Pedis)</strong>: Fungal skin infection between toes causing itching, peeling, redness, and sometimes odor.</li>
        <li><strong>Bacterial Conjunctivitis (Pink Eye)</strong>: Bacterial infection of the eye that produces redness, discharge, and irritation.</li>
        <li><strong>Dry Eye Syndrome</strong>: Occurs when eyes fail to produce enough tears, leading to dryness, discomfort, and blurry vision.</li>
        <li><strong>Eczema</strong>: Chronic skin condition that causes dry, itchy, red, and irritated skin, often related to allergies or sensitivities.</li>
        <li><strong>Glaucoma</strong>: Eye disease involving increased eye pressure that can damage the optic nerve, leading to vision loss if untreated.</li>
        <li><strong>Heart Attack (Myocardial Infarction)</strong>: Occurs when blood flow to part of the heart muscle is blocked, causing tissue damage.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat Rash</strong>: Skin condition caused by blocked sweat glands, leading to tiny blisters, redness, and itchiness in hot environments.</li>
        <li><strong>Hypertension</strong>: High blood pressure that strains the heart and arteries, increasing risk for cardiovascular complications.</li>
        <li><strong>Ingrown Nail</strong>: When the edge of a toenail grows into surrounding skin, leading to pain, swelling, and possible infection.</li>
        <li><strong>Myocarditis</strong>: Inflammation of the heart muscle, often caused by infection or autoimmune response, weakening heart function.</li>
        <li><strong>Psoriasis</strong>: Autoimmune skin condition where cells multiply too rapidly, forming thick, scaly patches of skin.</li>
        <li><strong>Sunburn</strong>: Skin injury caused by overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, resulting in redness, tenderness, and peeling skin.</li>
      </ul>
